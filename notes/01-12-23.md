# Notes from today

important - you should no longer use variables inside a inventory file.


``` bash
[fileservers]
file01
file02

[fileservers:vars]
ansible_user=ansible
ansible_password=@ansible2023
```

recommended approach is to use host_vars and groups_vars

When the state is not desired, then it will show things have changed to meet the desired state.
