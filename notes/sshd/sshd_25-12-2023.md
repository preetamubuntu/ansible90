# Notes on SSHD

some services pick changes when using systemctl reload servicename but some services needs to be restarted.


## Learned something on the way

How to configure firewall on rocky ?

`sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=2022/tcp --permanent`

How to check the wifi password ?

`nmcli device wifi show-password`

How to enable and start service in single line?

sudo systemctl enable --now servicename
e.g. servicename = httpd
`sudo systemctl enable --now httpd`

### Security settings

- MaxSessions default is 10
- UseDNS default is no. It basically does reverse lookup
- GSSAPIAuthentication use it only if you have kerbers based authentication


### Configure SELinux Port for SSH

you may change SSH port from 22 to something e.g. 2022. But it won't work unless you allows that via SELinux Policy.

### Keepalive Options

Server side there are three options available

- TCPKeepAlive: Purpose to disconnect sessions but it alone is should not be used. It should be used with the following two values
- ClientAliveInterval: After how many seconds should client send packet to inform server I'm alive
- ClientAliveCountMax: How many max packets should be sent

```bash
# default setting is commented out
sudo grep TCPKeepAlive /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#TCPKeepAlive yes 
sudo grep Client /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
#ClientAliveInterval 0 e.g. 30 seconds
#ClientAliveCountMax 3 e.g. 10 times
# total 300 seconds i.e. after 5 minutes session will be disconnected
```

But normally it is recommended to change the settings at client side with the following parameters

```bash
touch ~/.ssh/config
chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/config
vim ~/.ssh/config
# in the config file, please input these values
############## content of config file ##########
host *
ServerAliveInterval 30
ServerAliveCountMax 10
############## content of config file ##########
# save file

```

Memory tricks, both values have same character length (*in this case 20*) and they start with ServerAlive
