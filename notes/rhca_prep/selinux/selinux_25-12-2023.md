## To install manage page

To install manage page for selinux you need coreutils devel package. Package that was already installed as part of semanage, was **production** package

```bash
dnf whatprovides */semanage
Last metadata expiration check: 13:03:45 ago on Sun 24 Dec 2023 04:47:41 PM UTC.
policycoreutils-python-utils-3.5-3.el9_3.noarch : SELinux policy core python utilities
```

### Install package

But here we need a policycoreutils-devel package.

```bash
# step:01
dnf whatprovides */sepolicy
dnf install policycoreutils-devel -y

# step:02
# After this package is installed and then you need to install man pages
sepolicy manpage -a -p /usr/share/man/man8
# - a = all
# - p = path
# Why man8?
# step:03
# rebuild man database
mandb

# step:04
# search for specific context
man -k _selinux | grep httpd
# apache_selinux (8)   - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the httpd processes
# httpd_helper_selinux (8) - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the httpd_helper processes
# httpd_passwd_selinux (8) - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the httpd_passwd processes
# httpd_php_selinux (8) - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the httpd_php processes
# httpd_rotatelogs_selinux (8) - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the httpd_rotatelogs processes
# httpd_selinux (8)    - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the httpd processes
# httpd_suexec_selinux (8) - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the httpd_suexec processes
# httpd_sys_script_selinux (8) - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the httpd_sys_script processes
# httpd_unconfined_script_selinux (8) - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the httpd_unconfined_script processes
# httpd_user_script_selinux (8) - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the httpd_user_script processes

```

*Note:* man -k _selinux will provide you single page when you do not install man pages for selinux

## Restorecon - your rescue

All configuration you do is stored in the policy. To apply context settings from policy to the file, we use restorecon
Default settings are defined for the **most** files and directories in policy. In case, wrong context is applied, restorecon will be your rescuer

When you apply context to directory, all 

- new files get those context
- files moved in the directory also gets context i.e. inherited
- but files copied or moved with -a option do not get the context. In this case, you can use restorecon

### Relabel a file system

You can apply policy settings to entire file system by relabelling file system. It is simple method to ensure all policies are implemented on the file system.
Do note, policy is always guiding. If something in the policy is wrong, it might have a negative effect on the server.

Relabelling a file system is done either using

- `restorecon -Rv /` or
- `touch ./autorelabel` It is initiated when next time server is restarted and then this file is removed.

Autorelabel can occur without being intentionally planned.
e.g. you disable selinux for troubleshooting, and reboot and if there is already file present `/.autorelabel` it is automatically relabel file system
sometimes this operation can take a while.

Finally, follow the exercise 22-4 Using restorecon to Relabel Files

### GetseBoolean or SetseBoolean

There are pre-defined rules. It is not easy to create new rule. Instead you can enable or disable these rules using boolean.

```bash
# below provide the services on which boolean is set to on
getsebool -a | grep httpd | grep ' --> on'
httpd_builtin_scripting --> on
httpd_enable_cgi --> on
```

You can do runtime change using setsebool, but where does it says "It is runtime".

```bash
# e.g. setsebool -nameofthesetting on|off
sudo setsebool ftpd_anon_write on
sudo getsebool ftpd_anon_write
```

But above command does not show if this is runtime or permanent setting. For that you need to run

```bash
sudo semanage boolean -l | grep ftpd_anon_write
# ftpd_anon_write (on,off)
# Determine whether ftpd can modify public files used for public file transfer services. 
# Directories/Files must be labeled public_content_rw_t.

# lets make permanent change and check the result again
sudo setsebool -p ftpd_anon_write on # p = permanent

# Check the result
sudo semanage boolean -l | grep ftpd_anon_write 
# ftpd_anon_write (on,on)  
# Determine whether ftpd can modify public files used for public file transfer services. 
# Directories/Files must be labeled public_content_rw_t.

```

## Questions to review

### 1. You want to put SELinux temporarily in permissive mode. Which command do you use?

sudo setenforce 0

### 2. You need a list of all available Booleans. Which command do you use?

sudo getsebool -a

### 3. You do not see any service-specific SELinux man page. What solution do you need to apply?

install SELinux man page using following set of commands

```bash
sudo dnf install policycoreutils-devel -y
sudo sepolicy manpage -a -p /usr/share/man/man8
sudo mandb
sudo man -k _selinux

```

### 4. What is the name of the package you need to install to get easy-to-read SELinux log messages in the audit log?

sudo dnf install setroubleshoot-server

### 5. What commands do you need to run to apply the httpd_sys_content_t context type to the directory /web?

sudo semanage fcontext httpd_sys_content_t "/web(*./)?"

### 6. When would you use the chcon command?


### 7. Which file do you need to change if you want to completely disable SELinux?

grep ^SELINUX /etc/selinux/config

### 8. Where does SELinux log all of its messages?

sudo grep AVC /var/log/audit/audit.log

### 9. You have no clue which context types are available for the ftp service. What command enables you to get more specific information?

sudo getsebool -a | grep ftpd

### 10. Your service does not work as expected, and you want to know whether it is due to SELinux or something else. What is the easiest way to find out?
