Array (list) or Dictionary

## Array or Dictionary

In yaml, array is basically anything which is indented as '-' and dictionary is
a key value pair. Dictionary is coming from Python but not often used.

recommend strategy is to use list in yaml and an example of it is (though
i have used it so many times )

```yaml
name: create users
ansible.builtin.users
    - name: user1
      shell: /bin/bash
      comment: User1 Name
    - name: user2
      shell: /bin/bash
      comment: User2 Name  
```

In this case, {{ user[0] }} and {{ user[1] }} are items in a array.
