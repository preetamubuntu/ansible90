# Notes 

Something on file permissions

- If applied to a directory, read allows you to list the contents of that directory. 
- You should be aware that this permission does not allow you to read files in the directory as well.
- The Linux permission system does not know inheritance, and the only way to read a file is by using the read permissions on that file.
- To open a file for reading, however, it is convenient to have read permissions to the directory because you would not see the file otherwise.
- Notice that without read permission on the directory, you can still open the file if you know that a file with that name exists.
- This is not very convenient and for that reason not commonly done.
