# Notes 

## Something on file permissions

- If applied to a directory, read allows you to list the contents of that directory. 
- You should be aware that this permission does not allow you to read files in the directory as well.
- The Linux permission system does not know inheritance, and the only way to read a file is by using the read permissions on that file.
- To open a file for reading, however, it is convenient to have read permissions to the directory because you would not see the file otherwise.
- Notice that without read permission on the directory, you can still open the file if you know that a file with that name exists.
- This is not very convenient and for that reason not commonly done.

## Setting ACL

When you want more one group to be part of a Directory, then ACL comes into play. e.g.

```bash
[sugrible@rocky ~]$ ls -ld /web/
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 24 Jan 24 05:43 /web/

# lets add sales group permission using

sudo setfacl -m g:sales:rx /web

# now see the ACL

[sugrible@rocky ~]$ getfacl /web
getfacl: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names
# file: web
# owner: root
# group: root
user::rwx
group::r-x
group:sales:r-x
mask::r-x
other::r-x

```

And remember you must modify the default permission with `-R` option as shown below. This allows effective permission as configured on the new items

```bash
setfacl -R -m g:marketing:rwx /sales/data/

[sugrible@rocky ~]$ getfacl /sales/data/checkpermissions.txt 
getfacl: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names
# file: sales/data/checkpermissions.txt
# owner: sugrible
# group: sugrible
user::rw-
group::r-x
group:sales:r-x
group:marketing:rwx
mask::rwx
other::r--

```
