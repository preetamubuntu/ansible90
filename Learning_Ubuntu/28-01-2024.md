# Notes 

Something on file permissions

- If applied to a directory, read allows you to list the contents of that directory. 
- You should be aware that this permission does not allow you to read files in the directory as well.
- The Linux permission system does not know inheritance, and the only way to read a file is by using the read permissions on that file.
